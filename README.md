**Hello, I'm Ilya. I like coding in Rust.**

Here are the programs I've written so far:

**Advent of Code**

Advent of Code is a set of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language.

* [2023](https://github.com/NeoScripter/AOC_2023_Rust), solutions to year 2023 problems in Rust.
* [2022](https://github.com/NeoScripter/AOC_2022_Rust), solutions to year 2022 problems in Rust.
* [2021](https://github.com/NeoScripter/AOC_2021_Rust), solutions to year 2021 problems in Rust.
* [2020](https://github.com/NeoScripter/AOC_2020_Rust), solutions to year 2020 problems in Rust.
* [2019](https://github.com/NeoScripter/AOC_2019_Rust), solutions to year 2019 problems in Rust.
* [2018](https://github.com/NeoScripter/AOC_2018_Rust), solutions to year 2018 problems in Rust.
* [2017](https://github.com/NeoScripter/AOC_2017_Rust), solutions to year 2017 problems in Rust.
