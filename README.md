## 👋 About Me
Hey there! I'm a web developer who genuinely loves building high-quality, fast, and customizable websites and apps. I work with languages like Rust, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, and CSS, and I use frameworks and tools like Laravel, WordPress, and SCSS. I care a lot about performance and making sure my code is clean and maintainable.

I'm always eager to learn new things and improve my skills. Creating apps isn't just my job—it's what I enjoy doing most. If you want to see what I've been up to, feel free to check out my work!

## 🖥️ Programming Languages
**Rust:**
Rust was the first programming language I learned, and I quickly got hooked on its performance and type safety. I’ve used it to solve Advent of Code challenges and to make backend apps run faster.

**JavaScript:**
I use JavaScript every day for web development, sticking to ES6+ features to keep things clean and efficient. I usually prefer using TypeScript—it’s reliable, safe, and easier to manage in the long run.

**PHP:** 
PHP is my go-to for backend development. Whether I’m working on a Laravel app or a WordPress site, it’s great for handling things like email validation, sending, and other server-side tasks.

**HTML:**
HTML is my tool for building the structure of web pages. It’s straightforward and does exactly what I need to get the layout right.

**CSS:**
CSS is what I use to style websites and make them look great. I often rely on preprocessors like SCSS or tools like Tailwind, but I’m just as comfortable writing plain CSS when it’s needed.



## ⛃ Databases
**MySQL:**
I’m comfortable with MySQL and have worked on designing and managing databases, making sure queries are optimized for better performance.

**PostgreSQL:**
I use PostgreSQL when projects need more advanced database features. It’s great for keeping data secure and handling complex queries efficiently.

## ⚛ Frameworks
**React:**
I’ve worked on a few projects with React and know my way around its state management, lifecycle methods, and component-based structure.

**Node.js:**
I’m still learning Node.js and have built some small apps with it. I’ve focused mainly on async programming and working with streams

**Laravel:**
I’ve got solid experience with Laravel. I’ve used its MVC architecture to build scalable apps and custom CMS solutions that are easy to maintain.

## 🚀 JS Libraries
**jQuery:**
I’ve worked with jQuery on various projects, mainly for quick DOM manipulations and handling legacy code. While it’s not my first choice for modern apps, it’s still a handy tool when needed.

**Alpine.js:**
I’ve used Alpine.js to add interactivity to websites without the overhead of larger frameworks. It’s lightweight, straightforward, and perfect for things like dropdowns, modals, and simple animations.
